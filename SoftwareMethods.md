# Software Methodologies

## What kind of software-lifecycle models do you know?

There are several different software development lifecycle (SDLC) models that are used to guide the development process and help ensure that the final product meets the needs of the stakeholders. Some of the most popular models include:

Waterfall: This is a traditional, linear model that progresses through a series of distinct phases, such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next one can begin.

Agile: This is a flexible, iterative model that emphasizes rapid development and delivery, continuous feedback, and collaboration between the development team and stakeholders. Agile development is often done in sprints, which are short, time-boxed periods of development.

Scrum: This is an Agile framework that is used to manage and control the development process, it's based on the principles of Agile and it's commonly used in software development. Scrum defines a specific roles, ceremonies, and artifacts that help to manage the development process and ensure that the final product meets the needs of the stakeholders.
